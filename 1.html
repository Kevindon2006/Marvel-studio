After MEG acquired ToyBiz in 1993, Avi Arad of ToyBiz was named president and chief executive officer (CEO) of both the Marvel Films division and New World Family Filmworks, a New World Entertainment subsidiary. New World was MEG's former parent corporation and later a fellow subsidiary of the Andrews Group.[17][18] Marvel Productions became New World Animation by 1993 as Marvel would start up Marvel Films, including Marvel Films Animation.[17][19][20]> Marvel Films Animation shared Tom Tataranowicz with New World Animation as head of development and production.[21] New World Animation (The Incredible Hulk), Saban (X-Men: The Animated Series) and Marvel Films Animation (Spider-Man: The Animated Series) each produced a Marvel series for television for the 1996–1997 season.[22][20][23] By the end of 1993, Arad and 20th Century Fox struck a deal to make a film based on the X-Men.[24] In August 1996, New World Animation and Marvel Films Animation were sold along with the rest of New World by the Andrews Group to News Corporation and the Fox Entertainment Group. As part of the deal, Marvel licensed the rights to Captain America, Daredevil, and Silver Surfer to be on the Fox Kids Network and produced by Saban. New World Animation continued producing a second season of The Incredible Hulk for UPN.[22][25]</p>

     <h1>Formation of Marvel Studios and licensing films (1996–2004)</h1>
     <p>On August 7, 1996, Marvel Studios was created by Marvel. Filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to raise money to finance the new corporation, Marvel, Isaac Perlmutter's Zib, Inc., and Avi Arad sold ToyBiz stocks.[12][26] ToyBiz filed an offering of 7.5 million shares with a closing price of $20.125 at the time, making the offering worth approximately $150 million. ToyBiz sought to sell 1 million shares.[27] Jerry Calabrese, the president of Marvel Entertainment Group, and Avi Arad, head of Marvel Films and a director of ToyBiz, were assigned tandem control of Marvel Studios. Under Calabrese and Arad, Marvel sought to control pre-production by commissioning scripts, hiring directors, and casting characters, providing the package to a major studio partner for filming and distribution. Arad said of the goal for control, "When you get into business with a big studio, they are developing a hundred or 500 projects; you get totally lost. That isn't working for us. We're just not going to do it anymore. Period."[12] Marvel Studios arranged a seven-year development deal with 20th Century Fox to cover markets in the United States and internationally.[28]

In December 1996, Marvel Entertainment Group underwent a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization plan, including Marvel Studios as part of its strategic investment.[29] By 1997, Marvel Studios was actively pursuing various film productions based on Marvel characters, including the eventual films X-Men (2000), Daredevil (2003), Elektra (2005), and Fantastic Four (2005). Unproduced projects included Prince Namor, based on the character Namor and to be directed by Philip Kaufman, and Mort the Dead Teenager, based on the comic book of the same name and written by John Payson and Mort creator Larry Hama.[30] Marvel's Captain America animated series with Saban Entertainment for Fox Kids Network was set to premiere in late 1998. However, due to the bankruptcy, the series was canceled after only character designs and a one-minute promotional reel were made.[31][32][33]

The first film packaged and licensed by Marvel Studios was Blade (1998), by New Line Cinema, based on the vampire hunter Blade. The film was directed by Stephen Norrington and starred Wesley Snipes as Blade. It was released on August 21, 1998, grossing $131.2 million worldwide.[34] Blade was followed by X-Men, which was directed by Bryan Singer and was released on July 14, 2000. X-Men grossed $296.3 million worldwide.[35] Blade and X-Men demonstrated that widely popular films could be made out of comic book characters not familiar to the general public.[36] Leading up to X-Men's release, Marvel Studios negotiated a deal with then-functional Artisan Entertainment, successful with the low-budget The Blair Witch Project, for a co-production joint venture that included rights to 15 Marvel characters including Captain America, Thor (as a television series), Black Panther (with Snipes attached to produce and star), Deadpool, Iron Fist, Morbius, the Living Vampire, Longshot, Power Pack, Mort the Dead Teenager, Ant-Man,[37] and the Punisher.[38] Artisan would finance and distribute while Marvel would develop licensing and merchandising tie-ins. The resulting production library, which would also include television series, direct-to-video films, and internet projects, would be co-owned.[37] By 2001, the success of Marvel Entertainment's Ultimate Marvel imprint comics created leverage in Hollywood for Marvel Studios, pushing more properties into development.[39]</p>
